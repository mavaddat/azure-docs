This article lists and defines some of the key terms associated with Azure IoT Operations. The article includes usage guidance to help you use the terms correctly if you're talking or writing about Azure IoT Operations.

## Service and feature names

This section lists the names of the services and components that make up Azure IoT Operations.

### Azure IoT Operations Preview - enabled by Azure Arc

A unified data plane for the edge. It's a collection of modular, scalable, and highly available data services that run on Azure Arc-enabled edge Kubernetes clusters. It enables data capture from various different systems and integrates with data modeling applications such as Microsoft Fabric to help organizations deploy the industrial metaverse.

On first mention in an article, use _Azure IoT Operations Preview - enabled by Azure Arc_. On subsequent mentions, you can use _Azure IoT Operations_. Never use an acronym.

### Dataflows

This component lets you aggregate, enrich, normalize, and filter the data from your devices and assets. Dataflows is a data processing engine that lets you process data at the edge before you send it to the other services either at the edge or in the cloud.

### Azure IoT Layered Network Management Preview

This component lets you secure communication between devices and the cloud through isolated network environments based on the ISA-95/Purdue Network architecture.

On first mention in an article, use _Azure IoT Layered Network Management Preview_. On subsequent mentions, you can use _Layered Network Management_. Never use an acronym.

### MQTT broker
