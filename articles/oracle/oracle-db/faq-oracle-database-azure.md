# Oracle Database@Azure FAQs
This article answers frequently asked questions (FAQs) about the Oracle Database@Azure offering.

## General
In this section, we cover general questions about Oracle Database@Azure.

### How does Oracle Database@Azure work?
Oracle Database@Azure is enabled by hosting OCI’s infrastructure in Azure and natively integrated with Azure offering low-latency, high-bandwidth connectivity from your mission critical database tier to your application tier and rest of services in Azure. Enterprise critical features like RAC, Data Guard, Golden Gate, managed backups, self-managed RMAN backups, Zero Downtime Migration, on-premises connectivity, and seamless integration with other Azure services are supported. For more information, see [Overview - Oracle Database@Azure | Microsoft Learn](/azure/oracle/oracle-db/database-overview).

### How is Oracle Database@Azure different from OCI Interconnect and Oracle on Azure VMs?

- Oracle Database@Azure: Oracle Database@Azure (Oracle Database Service for Azure) is hosted on OCI’s infrastructure in Azure datacenters enabling you to host your mission critical Oracle databases closer to your application tier hosted in Azure. Azure virtual network integration with subnet delegation enables private IPs from customer virtual network to serve as database endpoints. This solution is Oracle managed and supported service in Azure.

- Oracle on Azure VMs: You can also deploy and self-manage your Oracle workloads on Azure VMs. Specifically, workloads that don't require features like RAC, Smart Scan or Exadata performance are best suited for this operation.

- OCI Interconnect: OCI interconnect is used to connect your Oracle deployments in OCI with Applications and services in Azure over OCI FastConnect and Azure ExpressRoute. This typically suits workloads/solutions that can work with the high latency envelope, have dependency on services, features, and functionalities running in both clouds.

### Is Oracle Database@Azure available on dedicated infrastructure or is it only available as a shared service? What is the isolation level?

There are two services offered as part of Oracle Database@Azure:

- Oracle Exadata Database Service on Dedicated Infrastructure runs on Dedicated Exadata infrastructure in Azure. You get dedicated Oracle CPUs (OCPUs) and storage, with isolation being at the node level.

- Oracle Autonomous Database Serverless is the other Oracle Database service offered at Azure and is on shared Exadata infrastructure.

### What are the Database versions supported on Oracle Database@Azure?

Oracle versions supported on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) are supported on Oracle Database@Azure. This includes 11 g to 19c, similar to Exadata Cloud Service in OCI. Versions older than 19c need upgrade support. For more information, see [Oracle Database Releases that Support Direct Upgrade](https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/18/upgrd/oracle-database-releases-that-support-direct-upgrade.html).

### Do you have any documented benchmark latency-wise between Azure resources and Oracle Database@Azure?

Latency between Azure resources and Oracle Database@Azure is within the Azure regional latency envelope as the Exadata infrastructure is within the Azure Data Centers. Latency can be further fine-tuned dependent on colocation within availability zones. For more information, see [What are availability zones?](/azure/reliability/availability-zones-overview?tabs=azure-cli).

### Does Oracle Database@Azure support deploying Base Database (BD), or do I need to migrate to Autonomous Database service?

No, Base Database isn't currently supported with Oracle Database@Azure. You can deploy single instance self-managed databases on Azure VMs or if you need Oracle managed databases with RAC, we recommend Autonomous Databases via Oracle Database@Azure. For more information, see [Autonomous Database | Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/cloud/azure/oracle-database-at-azure/) and [Provision Oracle Autonomous Databases | Microsoft Learn](provision-autonomous-oracle-databases.md).

### For the Oracle Database@Azure service, will the automated DR use Azure backbone or the OCI backbone?

BCDR is enabled using the OCI managed offering (Backup and Data Guard) and will use the Azure-OCI backbone.

### How many database servers can be deployed in each rack of Oracle Database@Azure? Is there flexibility in terms of being able to scale up and down as needed from both the consumption and licensing perspective?

Oracle Database@Azure currently runs on X9M hardware and provides a configuration of a minimum of two database servers and three Storage servers. This constitutes a quarter rack configuration. This configuration can be increased to a limit of 32 database servers and 64 Storage servers. You can scale up and down as needed within the Exadata system depending on your SKU.
