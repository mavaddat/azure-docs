# Overview of deploying Azure Operator Call Protection Preview

Azure Operator Call Protection Preview is built on Azure Communications Gateway.

- If you already have Azure Communications Gateway, you can enable Azure Operator Call Protection on it.
- If you don't have Azure Communications Gateway, you must deploy it first and then configure Azure Operator Call Protection.

## Planning your deployment

[!INCLUDE [operator-call-protection-provider-restriction](includes/operator-call-protection-provider-restriction.md)]

Your network must connect to Azure Communications Gateway and thus Azure Operator Call Protection over SIPREC.

- Azure Communications Gateway takes the role of the SIPREC Session Recording Server (SRS).
- An element in your network, typically a session border controller (SBC), must be set up as a SIPREC Session Recording Client (SRC).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This SIPREC connection is different to other services available through Azure Communication Gateway. Ensure your network design takes this into account.

When you deploy Azure Operator Call Protection, you can access Azure Communication's Gateway's _Included Benefits_ customer success and onboarding service. This onboarding service includes a project team to help you design and set up your network for success. For more information about Included Benefits, see [Onboarding with Included Benefits for Azure Communications Gateway](../communications-gateway/onboarding.md).

[Get started with Azure Communications Gateway](../communications-gateway/get-started.md) provides links to more information about deploying Azure Communications Gateway.
