> [!Note]
> We will retire Azure HDInsight on AKS on January 31, 2025. Before January 31, 2025, you will need to migrate your workloads to [Microsoft Fabric](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-fabric) or an equivalent Azure product to avoid abrupt termination of your workloads. The remaining clusters on your subscription will be stopped and removed from the host.
>
> Only basic support will be available until the retirement date.
