Only clients with valid certificates will be able to reach the app. This policy has been replaced by a new policy with the same name because Http 2.0 doesn't support client certificates. |Audit, Disabled |[3.1.0-deprecated](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/App%20Service/FunctionApp_Audit_ClientCert.json) |
